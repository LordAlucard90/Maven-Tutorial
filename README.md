# Maven-Tutorial

In this repository I'll follow the steps of the 
"[Apache Maven: Beginner to Guru](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-maven-beginner-to-guru/)" course.

The repository is divided by the main topics and each one is composed by the different course steps/lessons 
(step is not equal to video).
Each step contains a readme with the explanation of the step and, if is change from the previous step, the new code.
